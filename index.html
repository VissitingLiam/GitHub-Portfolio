    <p>
      Hello! I'm Liam, a person who always feels like learning something new. From learning a new coding language to learning how to be part of an organization. One of the things I recently learned to do is Web Development. It gave me unique challenges and a fresh perspective on how others approach it.

  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <p>Throughout my university years, I have accumulated a lot of valuable experience.</p>

  <p>I have observed how organizations operate and organize agendas at meetings.</p>
  <p>I have learned about database systems and unique software used for communication, such as AWS, SQL, MongoDB, and others.</p>
  <p>I gained leadership experience by directing a large group of people to construct projects within set deadlines and restricted budgets.</p>
  <p>I was part of a cybersecurity team preparing to partake in SANREN, learning various methods to protect systems and look out for hackers.</p>
  <p>I have experience helping and explaining IT concepts to others—from theory to coding—making complex topics easier to understand.</p>
